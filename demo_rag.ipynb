Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\n_Indexing_ starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\n_Retrieval_ . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\n_Generation_ . The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information contained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\n\\n\\n\\n_Retrieval Challenges_ . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\n_Generation Difficulties_ . In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces content not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\n_Augmentation Hurdles_ . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Determining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\n\\n\\n_B. Advanced RAG_\\n\\n\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing retrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata.

Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26].

RAG vs Fine-tuning_\\n\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable attention due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimization\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct characteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimensions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for precise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering realtime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant computational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] revealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised finetuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and computational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\n\\n\\nIII. RETRIEVAL\\n\\n\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\n\\n\\n_A. Retrieval Source_\\n\\n\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n_1) Data Structure:_ Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to include semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowledge Graph, KG) for enhancement. In addition to retrieving\\nfrom original external sources, there is also a growing trend in\\nrecent researches towards utilizing content generated by LLMs\\nthemselves for retrieval and enhancement purposes.',\n",

In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domainspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\n_Semi-structured data_ . typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Handling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves leveraging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substantial research opportunities in this area.\\n_Structured data_, such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86],\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise information. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n\\n\\n[4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html](https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html)\\n[5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR)\\n\\n\\n\\n(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\n_LLMs-Generated Content._ Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selector to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n_2) Retrieval Granularity:_ Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee semantic integrity and meeting the required knowledge. Choosing',\n",

       " {'text': 'the appropriate retrieval granularity during inference can be\\na simple and effective strategy to improve the retrieval and\\ndownstream task performance of dense retrievers.\\nIn text, retrieval granularity ranges from fine to coarse,\\nincluding Token, Phrase, Sentence, Proposition, Chunks, Document. Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained natural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\n\\n\\n_B. Indexing Optimization_\\n\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, segmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n_1) Chunking Strategy:_ The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. However, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window methods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Nevertheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n_2) Metadata Attachments:_ Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, author,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original documents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as introducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n_3) Structural Index:_ One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n_Hierarchical index structure_ . File are arranged in parentchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data summaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\n_Knowledge Graph index_ . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowledge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\n\\n\\n_C. Query Optimization_\\n\\n\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbreviations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to _large language model_ or a\\n_Master of Laws_ in a legal context.\\n\\n_1) Query Expansion:_ Expanding a single query into multiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\n_Multi-Query_ . By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\n_Sub-Query_ . The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\n_Chain-of-Verification(CoVe)_ . The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing hallucinations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].',\n",

       " {'text': '_2) Query Transformation:_ The core concept is to retrieve\\nchunks based on a transformed query instead of the user’s\\noriginal query.\\n_Query Rewrite_ .The original queries are not always optimal\\nfor LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The implementation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV.\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothetical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n_3) Query Routing:_ Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\n_Metadata Router/ Filter_ . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\n_Semantic Router_ is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router [6] . Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\n\\n\\n_D. Embedding_\\n\\n\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the question and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nVoyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard [7] evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Additionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n_1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval :_ Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can benefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n\\n\\n[6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router)\\n[7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n_2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model:_ In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, particularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing challenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\n\\n\\n_E. Adapter_\\n\\n\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as integrating functionality through an API or addressing constraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UPRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynamically select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition.

In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to generate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\n\\n\\nIV. GENERATION\\n\\n\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\n\\n\\n_A. Context Curation_\\n\\n\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final generation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n_1) Reranking:_ Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language models like GPT [12], [99].\\n_2) Context Selection/Compression:_ A common misconception in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative samples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the number of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\n\\n\\n_B. LLM Fine-tuning_\\n\\n\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data characteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a particular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align preferences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\n\\n\\nV. AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\n\\n\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insufficient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\n\\n\\n_A.

(left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\n\\n\\n\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discontinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITERRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that leverages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generationenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\n\\n\\n_B. Recursive Retrieval_\\n\\n\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\\n\\n\\n\\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\n\\n\\n_C. Adaptive Retrieval_\\n\\n\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and GraphToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, divides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and employ few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning framework to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines.

TASK AND EVALUATION\\n\\n\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\n\\n\\n_A. Downstream Task_\\n\\n\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiplechoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Information Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\n\\n\\n_B. Evaluation Target_\\n\\n\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these taskspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\n_Retrieval Quality_ . Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\nof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\n_Generation Quality_ . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\n\\n\\n_C. Evaluation Aspects_\\n\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models emphasize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n_1) Quality Scores:_ Quality scores include context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These quality scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from\\ndifferent perspectives in the process of information retrieval\\nand generation [164]–[166].\\n_Context Relevance_ evaluates the precision and specificity\\nof the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing\\nprocessing costs associated with extraneous content.\\n_Answer Faithfulness_ ensures that the generated answers\\nremain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency\\nand avoiding contradictions.\\n_Answer Relevance_ requires that the generated answers are\\ndirectly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing\\nthe core inquiry.\\n_2) Required Abilities:_ RAG evaluation also encompasses\\nfour abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:\\nnoise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are\\ncritical for the model’s performance under various challenges\\nand complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores.\\n_Noise Robustness_ appraises the model’s capability to manage noise documents that are question-related but lack substantive information.\\n_Negative Rejection_ assesses the model’s discernment in\\nrefraining from responding when the retrieved documents do\\nnot contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question.\\n_Information Integration_ evaluates the model’s proficiency in\\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to address\\ncomplex questions.\\n_Counterfactual Robustness_ tests the model’s ability to recognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,\\neven when instructed about potential misinformation.\\nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for\\nevaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,\\nanswer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,\\nand counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the\\nquality of generation.',\n",

It is essential to recognize that these\\nmetrics, derived from related work, are traditional measures\\nand do not yet represent a mature or standardized approach for\\nquantifying RAG evaluation aspects. Custom metrics tailored\\nto the nuances of RAG models, though not included here, have\\nalso been developed in some evaluation studies.\\n\\n\\n_D. Evaluation Benchmarks and Tools_\\n\\n\\nA series of benchmark tests and tools have been proposed\\nto facilitate the evaluation of RAG.These instruments furnish\\nquantitative metrics that not only gauge RAG model performance but also enhance comprehension of the model’s capabilities across various evaluation aspects. Prominent benchmarks\\nsuch as RGB, RECALL and CRUD [167]–[169] focus on\\nappraising the essential abilities of RAG models. Concurrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164],\\nARES [165], and TruLens [8] employ LLMs to adjudicate the\\nquality scores. These tools and benchmarks collectively form\\na robust framework for the systematic evaluation of RAG\\nmodels, as summarized in Table IV.\\n\\n\\nVII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\n\\n\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, several challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\n\\n\\n_A. RAG vs Long Context_\\n\\n\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens [9] . This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n\\n\\n[8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts rag triad/](https://www.trulens.org/trulens_eval/core_concepts_rag_triad/)\\n[9https://kimi.moonshot.cn](https://kimi.moonshot.cn)\\n\\n\\n\\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated answers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\n\\n\\n_B. RAG Robustness_\\n\\n\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\n\\n\\n_C. Hybrid Approaches_\\n\\n\\nCombining RAG with fine-tuning is emerging as a leading\\nstrategy. Determining the optimal integration of RAG and\\nfine-tuning whether sequential, alternating, or through end-toend joint training—and how to harness both parameterized',\n",

Readers are encouraged to consult pertinent literature for the specific quantification formulas associated with these_\\n_metrics, as required._\\n\\n\\n\\nand non-parameterized advantages are areas ripe for exploration [27]. Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved documents for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\n\\n\\n_D. Scaling laws of RAG_\\n\\n\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current researchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law [10], where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\n\\n\\n_E. Production-Ready RAG_\\n\\n\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering requirements have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing retrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowledge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n\\n\\n[10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize](https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize)\\n\\n\\n\\ninadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAGrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba [11] is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12\\n\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n\\n\\n[11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba)\\n[12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/)',\n",

Multi-modal RAG_\\n\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based questionanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\n_Image_ .

The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant advancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text conversion [180].

RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion generation and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\n\\n\\nVIII. CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, emphasizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal domains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion highlights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deployment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.',\n",
